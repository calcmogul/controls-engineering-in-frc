\section{Differential equations}

A \textit{differential equation} is an equation containing derivatives.

Let $y$ be an unknown function of $x$ and $f$ be a given function of $x$. An
\textit{ordinary differential equation} (ODE) contains an unknown function of
one variable $x$, the unknown function's derivatives, and given functions of
$x$. For example,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)
\end{equation*}

Let $y$ be an unknown function of $x_1$ and $x_2$. A \textit{partial
differential equation} (PDE) contains unknown multivariable functions and their
partial derivatives. For example,
\begin{equation*}
  y(x_1, x_2) = x_1 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_1} +
    x_2 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_2}
\end{equation*}

Some ODEs and PDEs have closed form solutions (e.g., $y(x) = y(0)e^{ax}$ for the
ODE $\frac{dy}{dx} = ay$), but most must be solved numerically with a computer
instead.
