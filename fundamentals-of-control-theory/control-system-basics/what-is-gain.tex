\section{What is gain?}
\index{gain}

\Gls{gain} is a proportional value that shows the relationship between the
magnitude of an input signal to the magnitude of an output signal at
steady-state. Many \glspl{system} contain a method by which the gain can be
altered, providing more or less ``power" to the \gls{system}.

Figure \ref{fig:input_output_gain} shows a \gls{system} with a hypothetical
input and output. Since the output is twice the amplitude of the input, the
\gls{system} has a gain of $2$.
