\section*{Motivation}

I am the software mentor for a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team. My
responsibilities for that include teaching programming, software engineering
practices, and applications of control theory. The curriculum I developed so far
(located at \url{https://csweb.frc3512.com/ci/}) teaches rookies enough to be
minimally competitive, but many of the more advanced sections are incomplete. It
provides no formal avenues of growth for veteran students.

Also, out of a six week build season, the software team usually only gets a few
days with the completed robot due to poor build schedule management. This leads
to two problems. First, two days is only enough time to verify basic software
functionality, not test and tune feedback controllers. Second, this is also the
first time the robot's electromechanical systems have been tested after
integration, so any issues that arise consume valuable software integration time
while the team traces the problem to a mechanical, electrical, or software
cause.

This book expands my curriculum to cover control theory topics I have learned in
my graduate-level engineering classes at University of California, Santa Cruz.
It introduces state-space controllers and serves as a practical guide for
formulating and implementing them. Since state-space control utilizes a system
model, both problems mentioned earlier can be addressed. Basic software
functionality can be tested against it and feedback controllers can be tuned
automatically based on system constraints. This allows software teams to test
their work much earlier in the build season in a controlled environment as well
as save time during feedback controller design, implementation, and testing.

I originally started writing this book because I felt that the topic wasn't
difficult, but the information for it wasn't easily accessible. When I was a
high school robotics team member, I had to learn everything from scratch through
various internet sources and eventually from college courses as part of my
bachelor's degree. Control theory has a certain beauty to it, and I want more
people to appreciate it the way I do. Therefore, my goal is to make the learning
process quicker and easier for the team members who come after me by collating
all the relevant information.

\section*{Intended audience}

This guide is intended to make an advanced engineering topic approachable so it
can be applied by those who aren't experts in control theory. My intended
audience is high school students who are members of a FIRST Robotics Competition
team. As such, they will likely have passing knowledge of PID control and have
basic proficiency in programming. This guide will will expand their incomplete
understanding of control theory to include the fundamentals of classical control
theory, enough linear algebra to understand the notation and mechanics of modern
control, and finally how to apply modern control to design challenges they
regularly see in their FRC robots from year to year.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my controls engineering instructors Dejan Milutinovi\'c
and Gabriel Elkaim of University of California, Santa Cruz. They taught their
classes from a pragmatic perspective focused on application and intuition that I
appreciated. I would also like to thank Dejan Milutinovi\'c for introducing me
to the field of control theory and both of my instructors for teaching me what
it means to be a controls engineer.

Thanks to Austin Schuh from FRC team 971 for providing the final continuous
state-space models used in the examples section.
