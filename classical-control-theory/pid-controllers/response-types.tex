\section{Response types}

A \gls{system} driven by a PID controller generally has three types of
responses: underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. These are shown in
figure \ref{fig:pid_responses}.

For the \glspl{step response} in figure \ref{fig:pid_responses}, \gls{rise time}
is the time the \gls{system} takes to initially reach the \gls{reference} after
applying the \gls{step input}. \Gls{settling time} is the time the \gls{system}
takes to settle at the \gls{reference} after the \gls{step input} is applied. An
underdamped response oscillates around the \gls{reference} before settling. An
overdamped response is slow to rise and does not overshoot the \gls{reference}.
A critically damped response has the fastest \gls{rise time} without
overshooting the \gls{reference}.
