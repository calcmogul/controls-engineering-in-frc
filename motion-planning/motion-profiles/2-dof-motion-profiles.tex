In FRC, point-to-point movements with two degrees of freedom ($2$ DOFs) are
almost always within the context of drivetrains where the two degrees of freedom
are the $x$ and $y$ axes.

A \textit{path} is a set of (x, y) points for the drivetrain to follow. A
drivetrain \textit{trajectory} is a path that includes both the states (e.g.,
position and velocity) and control inputs (e.g., voltage) of the drivetrain as
functions of time.

Currently, the most common form of multidimensional trajectory planning in FRC
is based on polynomial splines.
