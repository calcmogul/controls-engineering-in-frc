\section{1-DOF systems}

1-DOF systems are straightforward. We define the minimum and maximum position
constraints for the arm, elevator, etc. and ensure we stay between them. To do
so, we might use some combination of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Rejecting, coercing, or clamping setpoints so that they are always
    within the valid range
  \item Soft limits on the speed controller
  \item Limit switches, and/or physical hard stops
\end{enumerate}
