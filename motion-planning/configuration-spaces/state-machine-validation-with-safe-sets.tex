\section{State machine validation with safe sets}

Configuration spaces can also be used for state machine validation. The states
of all the mechanisms, including solenoid actuation states, would be axes in a
configuration space. A state machine unit test would define a valid path through
the configuration space, send the desired events to the state machine, then
ensure the robot took the correct path in response to each event for all
iterations.
