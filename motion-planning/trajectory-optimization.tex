\chapter{Trajectory optimization}
\index{motion planning!trajectory optimization}

A \textit{trajectory} is a collection of samples defined over some time
interval. A drivetrain trajectory would include its states (e.g., x position, y
position, heading, and velocity) and control inputs (e.g., voltage).

\textit{Trajectory optimization} finds the best choice of trajectory (for some
mathematical definition of ``best") by formulating and solving a constrained
optimization problem.
