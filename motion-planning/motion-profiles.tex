\chapter{Motion profiles}

If smooth, predictable motion of a \gls{system} over time is desired, it's best
to only change a \gls{system}'s \gls{reference} as fast as the \gls{system} is
able to physically move. Motion profiles, also known as trajectories, are used
for this purpose. For multi-state \glspl{system}, each \gls{state} is given its
own trajectory. Since these \glspl{state} are usually position and velocity,
they share different derivatives of the same profile.
