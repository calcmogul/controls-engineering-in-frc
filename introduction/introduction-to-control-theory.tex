\chapter{Introduction to control theory}

Control systems are all around us and we interact with them daily. A small list
of ones you may have seen includes heaters and air conditioners with
thermostats, cruise control and the anti-lock braking system (ABS) on
automobiles, and fan speed modulation on modern laptops. \Glspl{control system}
monitor or control the behavior of \glspl{system} like these and may consist of
humans controlling them directly (manual control), or of only machines
(automatic control).

How can we prove closed-loop \glspl{controller} on an autonomous car, for
example, will behave safely and meet the desired performance specifications in
the presence of uncertainty? Control theory is an application of algebra and
geometry used to analyze and predict the behavior of \glspl{system}, make them
respond how we want them to, and make them \glslink{robustness}{robust} to
\glspl{disturbance} and uncertainty.

Controls engineering is, put simply, the engineering process applied to control
theory. As such, it's more than just applied math. While control theory has some
beautiful math behind it, controls engineering is an engineering discipline like
any other that is filled with trade-offs. The solutions control theory gives
should always be sanity checked and informed by our performance specifications.
We don't need to be perfect; we just need to be good enough to meet our
specifications (see section \ref{sec:the_mindset_of_an_egoless_engineer} for
more on engineering).
