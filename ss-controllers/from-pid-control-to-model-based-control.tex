\section{From PID control to model-based control}
\index{PID control}

As mentioned before, controls engineers have a more general framework to
describe control theory than just PID control. PID controller designers are
focused on fiddling with controller parameters relating to the current, past,
and future error rather than the underlying system states. Integral control is a
commonly used tool, and some people use integral action as the majority of the
control action. While this approach works in a lot of situations, it is an
incomplete view of the world.

Model-based control has a completely different mindset. Controls designers using
model-based control care about developing an accurate model of the system, then
driving the states they care about to zero (or to a \gls{reference}). Integral
control is added with $u_{error}$ estimation if needed to handle model
uncertainty, but we prefer not to use it because its response is hard to tune
and some of its destabilizing dynamics aren't visible during simulation.
