We'll skip the probability derivations here, but given two data points with
associated variances represented by Gaussian distributions, the information can
be optimally combined into a third Gaussian distribution with its own mean value
and variance. The expected value of $x$ given a measurement $z_1$ is

\begin{equation}
  E[x|z_1] = \mu = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2}z_1 +
    \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2}x_0
\end{equation}

The variance of $x$ given $z_1$ is

\begin{equation}
  E[(x - \mu)^2|z_1] = \frac{\sigma^2 \sigma_0^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2}
\end{equation}

The expected value, which is also the maximum likelihood value, is the linear
combination of the prior expected (maximum likelihood) value and the
measurement. The expected value is a reasonable estimator of $x$.

\begin{align}
  \hat{x} &= E[x|z_1] = \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2}z_1 +
    \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2}x_0 \\
  \hat{x} &= w_1 z_1 + w_2 x_0 \nonumber
\end{align}

Note that the weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ sum to $1$. When the prior (i.e., prior
knowledge of \gls{state}) is uninformative (a large variance)

\begin{align}
  w_1 &= \lim_{\sigma_0^2 \to 0} \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2} = 0 \\
  w_2 &= \lim_{\sigma_0^2 \to 0} \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2} = 1
\end{align}

and $\hat{x} = z_1$. That is, the weight is on the observations and the estimate
is equal to the measurement.

Let us assume we have a \gls{model} providing an almost exact prior for $x$. In
that case, $\sigma_0^2$ approaches 0 and

\begin{align}
  w_1 &= \lim_{\sigma_0^2 \to 0} \frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2} = 1 \\
  w_2 &= \lim_{\sigma_0^2 \to 0} \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2} = 0
\end{align}

The Kalman filter uses this optimal fusion as the basis for its operation.
