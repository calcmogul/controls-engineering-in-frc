\section{Limitations}

PID's heuristic method of tuning is a reasonable choice when there is no a
priori knowledge of the \gls{system} dynamics. However, controllers with much
better response can be developed if a \glslink{model}{dynamical model} of the
\gls{system} is known. Furthermore, PID only applies to single-input,
single-output (SISO) \glspl{system} and can drive up to two \glspl{state} to
\glspl{reference} by using both the proportional and integral terms. We'll
revisit this in subsection \ref{subsec:flywheel_pid_control}.
