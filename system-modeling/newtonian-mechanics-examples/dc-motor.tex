\section{DC motor}
\label{sec:dc_motor}

We will be deriving a first-order \gls{model} for a DC motor. A second-order
\gls{model} would include the inductance of the motor windings as well, but
we're assuming the time constant of the inductor is small enough that its affect
on the \gls{model} behavior is negligible for FRC use cases (see subsection
\ref{subsec:do_flywheels_need_pd_control} for a demonstration of this for a real
DC motor).
\begin{remark}
  For the brushless motor commutation methods currently available in FRC
  (trapezoidal commutation, field-oriented control), brushed and brushless DC
  motors have the same dynamics. However, more advanced commutation methods can
  break the linear back-EMF assumption of the brushed motor model.
\end{remark}

The first-order \gls{model} will only require numbers from the motor's
datasheet. The second-order \gls{model} would require measuring the motor
inductance as well, which generally isn't in the datasheet. It can be difficult
to measure accurately without the right equipment.

\subsection{Equations of motion}

The circuit for a DC motor is shown in figure
\ref{fig:dc_motor_circuit}.
\begin{bookfigure}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[auto, >=latex', circuit ee IEC,
                      set resistor graphic=var resistor IEC graphic]
    \node [opencircuit] (start) at (0,0) {};
    \node [] (V+) at (-0.5,0) { $+$ };
    \node [opencircuit] (end) at (0,-3.5) {};
    \node [] (V-) at (-0.5,-3.5) { $-$ };
    \node [coordinate] (topright) at (2.5,0) {};
    \node [coordinate] (bottomright) at (2.5,-3.5) {};
    \node [] at (0, -1.75) { $V$ };
    \draw (start) to (topright)
                  to [resistor={near start, info'={ $R$ }},
                      voltage source={near end, direction info'={<-},
                      info={ $V_{emf}=\frac{\omega}{K_v}$ }}] (bottomright)
                  to (end);
  \end{tikzpicture}

  \caption{DC motor circuit}
  \label{fig:dc_motor_circuit}
\end{bookfigure}

$V$ is the voltage applied to the motor, $I$ is the current through the motor in
Amps, $R$ is the resistance across the motor in Ohms, $\omega$ is the angular
velocity of the motor in radians per second, and $K_v$ is the angular velocity
constant in radians per second per Volt. This circuit reflects the following
relation.
\begin{equation}
  V = IR + \frac{\omega}{K_v} \label{eq:motor_V}
\end{equation}

The mechanical relation for a DC motor is
\begin{equation}
  \tau = K_t I
\end{equation}

where $\tau$ is the torque produced by the motor in Newton-meters and $K_t$ is
the torque constant in Newton-meters per Amp. Therefore
\begin{equation*}
  I = \frac{\tau}{K_t}
\end{equation*}

Substitute this into equation \eqref{eq:motor_V}.

\index{FRC models!DC motor equations}
\begin{equation}
  V = \frac{\tau}{K_t} R + \frac{\omega}{K_v} \label{eq:motor_tau_V}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Calculating constants}

A typical motor's datasheet should include graphs of the motor's measured torque
and current for different angular velocities for a given voltage applied to the
motor. Figure \ref{fig:motor_data} is an example. An FRC motor's datasheet can
be found on its vendor's website.
\begin{svg}{build/\chapterpath/motor_data}
  \caption{Example motor datasheet for 775pro}
  \label{fig:motor_data}
\end{svg}

\subsubsection{Torque constant $K_t$}
\begin{align}
  \tau &= K_t I \nonumber \\
  K_t &= \frac{\tau}{I} \nonumber \\
  K_t &= \frac{\tau_{stall}}{I_{stall}}
\end{align}

where $\tau_{stall}$ is the stall torque and $I_{stall}$ is the stall current of
the motor from its datasheet.

\subsubsection{Resistance $R$}

Recall equation \eqref{eq:motor_V}.
\begin{align}
  V &= IR + \frac{\omega}{K_v} \nonumber
  \intertext{When the motor is stalled, $\omega = 0$.}
  V &= I_{stall} R \nonumber \\
  R &= \frac{V}{I_{stall}}
\end{align}

where $I_{stall}$ is the stall current of the motor and $V$ is the voltage
applied to the motor at stall.

\subsubsection{Angular velocity constant $K_v$}

Recall equation \eqref{eq:motor_V}.
\begin{align}
  V &= IR + \frac{\omega}{K_v} \nonumber \\
  V - IR &= \frac{\omega}{K_v} \nonumber \\
  K_v &= \frac{\omega}{V - IR} \nonumber
  \intertext{When the motor is spinning under no load,}
  K_v &= \frac{\omega_{free}}{V - I_{free}R}
\end{align}

where $\omega_{free}$ is the angular velocity of the motor under no load (also
known as the free speed), and $V$ is the voltage applied to the motor when it's
spinning at $\omega_{free}$, and $I_{free}$ is the current drawn by the motor
under no load.
\begin{remark}
  To model a mechanism with several identical motors in one gearbox, multiply
  the stall torque, stall current, and free current by the number of motors $N$.
  $K_t$ and $K_v$ will be the same because $N$ cancels out, but $R$ will be
  divided by $N$. This multiplies the acceleration contribution of each model
  term by $N$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Current limiting}

Current limiting of a DC motor reduces the maximum input voltage to avoid
exceeding a current threshold. Predictive current limiting uses a projected
estimate of the current, so the voltage is reduced before the current threshold
is exceeded. Reactive current limiting uses an actual current measurement, so
the voltage is reduced after the current threshold is exceeded.

The following pseudocode demonstrates each type of current limiting.
\begin{code}
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=customPython]
# Normal feedback control
V = K @ (r - x)

# Calculations for predictive current limiting
omega = angular_velocity_measurement
I = V / R - omega / (Kv * R)

# Calculations for reactive current limiting
I = current_measurement
omega = Kv * V - I * R * Kv  # or can be angular velocity measurement

# If predicted/actual current above max, limit current by reducing voltage
if I > I_max:
    V = I_max * R + omega / Kv
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Limits current of DC motor to $I_{max}$}
\end{code}
