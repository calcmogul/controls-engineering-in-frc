\section{Further reading}

To learn more about nonlinear control, watch MIT's underactuated robotics
lectures and read their course notes \cite{bib:underactuated_book}.

The books \textit{Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos} by Steven Strogatz and
\textit{Applied Nonlinear Control} by Jean-Jacques Slotine are also good
references.
