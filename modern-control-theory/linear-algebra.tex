\chapter{Linear algebra}

Modern control theory borrows concepts from linear algebra. At first, linear
algebra may appear very abstract, but there are simple geometric intuitions
underlying it. First, watch 3Blue1Brown's preview video for the
\textit{Essence of linear algebra} video series (5 minutes)
\cite{bib:linalg_preview}. The goal here is to provide an intuitive, geometric
understanding of linear algebra as a method of linear transformations.

We would normally include written material here for learning linear algebra, but
3Blue1Brown's animated videos are better at conveying the geometric intuition
involved than anything we could write here with static text. Instead of making
an inferior copy of his work, we'll provide bibliography entries for a selection
of his videos.
