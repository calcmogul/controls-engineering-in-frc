\chapter{Linear algebra}

Modern control theory borrows concepts from linear algebra. At first, linear
algebra may appear very abstract, but there are simple geometric intuitions
underlying it. First, watch 3Blue1Brown's preview video for the
\textit{Essence of linear algebra} video series (5 minutes)
\cite{bib:linalg_preview}. The goal here is to provide an intuitive, geometric
understanding of linear algebra as a method of linear transformations.

While only a subset of the material from the videos will be presented here that
we think is relevant to this book, we highly suggest watching the whole series
\cite{bib:essence_of_linalg}.

\begin{remark}
  The following sections are essentially transcripts of the video content for
  those who don't want to watch an hour of YouTube videos. However, we suggest
  watching the videos instead because animations are better at conveying the
  geometric intuition involved than text.
\end{remark}
